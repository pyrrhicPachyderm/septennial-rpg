\section{Skills}
\seclabel{skill-ranks}

There are many skills that a wizard may develop through their education, and several facets in which they may develop each skill (see \secref{skill-list} below).
Each of a student wizard's skills is represented by a set of three numbers ranging from 0 to 7, such as \skillrank{6}{4}{3}.
The first number represents the depth of their education or training in a skill, and hence determines the maximum they are able to achieve.
The latter two numbers represent the breadth of their education, or how well practised they are.
A student lacking this breadth may have the potential to do very well, but their performance will be less reliable.

All students enter the school with their skills ranked \skillrank{0}{0}{0}.
They still roll 3 dice for {\tests}, so they're not totally incompetent.
But they've all just come out of primary education; they haven't yet specialised.
Characters advance their skills by taking classes and participating in extracurricular activities.
Each class or extracurricular will advance one or more skills.

Each time within a year that a character advances a skill, they add 1 to one of the three numbers representing their skill, working from left to right.
As such, a character cannot benefit from advancing the same skill more than three times in a year.
Furthermore, none of the numbers in a character's skill may exceed their current year level.
At maximum, a character may graduate with a skill ranked \skillrank{7}{7}{7}.

As an example, consider the Athletics skill of Dalton Robins over his first four years of school.
Dalton enters school with his Athletics ranked at \skillrank{0}{0}{0}, the same as everyone else.
In first year he participates in enough sport to advance his Athletics twice, raising the first two numbers of his skill, making it \skillrank{1}{1}{0}.
In second year he does a little less sport and advances Athletics only once, raising only the first number of his skill, making it \skillrank{2}{1}{0}.
In third year he does no sport at all, leaving his skill at \skillrank{2}{1}{0}.
In fourth year, feeling himself growing unfit, Dalton returns to sport with a vengeance and advances Athletics four times.
The first three advances raise all three numbers of his skill, making it \skillrank{3}{2}{1}, but the fourth advance is wasted.
