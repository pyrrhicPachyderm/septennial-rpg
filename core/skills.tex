\chapter{Skills \& Tests}
\chaplabel{skills}

The life of a student wizard is filled with tests.
Midterm tests, weekly class assignments, and the dreaded end of semester exams.
But those aren't the sort of tests this chapter is about.

For in truth, a wizard's skills, both magical and mundane, are being tested for more often than they realise.
Whenever they struggle to control a turbulent spell,
whenever they hurl a ball down the field after school,
whenever they try to convince a teacher that a hippogriff really \emph{did} eat their homework.
They may not be receiving a grade for their work, but they are still calling upon the depths of their knowledge and practice.
It is these everyday tests, and the skills they require, that are the subject of this chapter.
